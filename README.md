Automated Sakai Login Script Using Selenium and Python
Situation:
Manually logging into the Sakai e-learning platform every time I needed access felt repetitive and time-consuming. Each session required opening the browser, navigating to the login page, and entering my credentials, which detracted from my efficiency.

Task:
I wanted to streamline this process by automating the login procedure. My goal was to create a script that would automatically open my preferred browser, enter my credentials securely, log me into Sakai, and keep the browser open for a duration I could control. This would save me time and allow me to focus on my tasks rather than dealing with repeated manual logins.

Action:
To achieve this, I used Python and Selenium to develop a script that automates the entire login process. The script securely takes in user credentials, navigates to the Sakai platform's login page, and automatically submits the login form. I also built in a timer that allows the browser to stay open for a user-specified period before automatically closing. The script is designed to be run on demand, giving me full control over when I access the platform.

Result:
The automated login script has significantly improved my workflow, eliminating the need to manually log in every time. Now, I can log in to Sakai with a single command, which saves time and reduces the repetitive tasks in my daily routine. Additionally, it provides a practical demonstration of browser automation with Selenium, which can be applied to other similar tasks in the future.
